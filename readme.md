# Recommender System - Content Based Filtering #

## Books Recommendation System ##

Creating **content-based filtering recommendation system** using [Goodbooks-10k Dataset](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). I decided to create **two machine learning model** and test it to see the result:

- **Model1_CosSim.py** :  
Model 1 using **Cosine_Similarity** for machine learning model. The result is **significantly faster** than model 2.  

- **Model2_Corrwith.py** :  
Model 2 using **corrwith** for machine learning model and based on the _content_ and _user rating_. This model is **very slow** to run due to its size but have better prediction of recommendation system than _model 1_.
